### Churn detection project
Conducted extensive exploration, analysis and modeling on real-world data of Taiwan's leading music streaming platform.
In this project, I performed all of the steps in a machine learning worfklow: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis,
feature engineering, modeling (supervised and clustering) and model evaluation.
I was able to create a highly accurate classification model that is ble to accurately predict which clients are more likely to churn.
