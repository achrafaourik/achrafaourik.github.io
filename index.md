### Churn detection project
Conducted extensive analysis on real-world data of Taiwan's leading music streaming platform.
In this project, I performed all of the steps in a machine learning worfklow: <b>data cleaning, exploratory data analysis,
feature engineering, modeling (supervised and clustering) and model evaluation.</b>
I was able to create a highly accurate classification model that is able to accurately <b>predict which clients are more likely to churn.</b>
